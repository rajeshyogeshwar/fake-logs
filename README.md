# fake-logs

fake-logs is a fake logs generator command line tool as well as a package that can be imported and used within the python code.

### Inspiration

While learning Apache Kafka, I wanted to play around with huge volume of data and I also wanted to generate it. So I wrote this one.

### What's next?

Once I have added a few more log generator engines I intend to release this on pypi.
